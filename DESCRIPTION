Description: CustomGenome generates a new Ensembl reference genome
    sequence and annotation files with custom FASTA sequences (e.g.
    GFP, Tomato) and produces RNA-seq count matrices with them. Genome
    reference files are fetched and validated directly from Ensembl,
    user-sequences are then appended to both, and then the new
    reference files are written to disk. Downstream analysis is then
    facilitated via Rsubread function wrappers to index the new
    reference, align user FASTA sequences to it, and then perform
    quantification for desired features (e.g. exon, utr, etc.)
